Detached signatures for Classic deterministic builds

These are created and committed by the Classic release creator person, who
must have a copy of the private keys used to sign binaries.

Everybody else can then use the gitian-*-signer.yml deterministic build to
add the signature to their binaries, and verify that everybody's results
match.
